#A Hacking Simulator Game written in Ruby
---
I'm trying to get the essence of what it's like to hack computer networks. 

I want the user to feel like they are sitting at a real terminal, pseudo real at least, typing in commands, reading responses, pieceing info together to find weaknesses, but without all the boring waiting around.

Simulation of a network of computers could do something like this, so I hope I'll make something fun and learn ruby along the way.
